I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at University of Washington advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](https://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Alex Leudtke](https://www.alexluedtke.com/). My research interests involve generative modeling, optimal transport, gradient flows, and deep learning in general. I am interested in application of optimal transport and gradient flows in statistical inference and explainable artificial intelligence. At UW, I am fortunate to be working with [Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~soumik/) on optimal transport.

I did my undergraduate in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) with a minor in English literature. At IITK, I worked on developing methods for output analysis and convergence diagnostics of Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling with [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io).
